# Pong
# An attempt at creating the old time game Pong. Supports Windows, Mac and Linux
# Each distinct file has it's own version, depending on your operating system
# The sole difference in the three sets of code is the way the sound is coded into the game
# Mac and Linux are very similar, only one letter in the sound play command differs
# Windows requires loading in a different module with different commands
# Despite that everything is the same
# Remember to save the bounce.wav file in the same folder as the pong file for easier directory reading
# Otherwise you will have to edit for your own desired directory
